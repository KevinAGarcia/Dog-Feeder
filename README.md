# Dog-Feeder

An automatic dog feeder is a device designed to dispense food to your dog at pre-determined intervals or on-demand without requiring your direct involvement. It can be a convenient solution for pet owners who have busy schedules, need to be away from home for extended periods, or want to regulate their dog's feeding schedule more effectively. 

The purpose of this project is to understand te basics of state machines.

1. State machines

State machines, also known as finite-state machines (FSMs), are computational models used to represent systems that exhibit discrete, sequential behavior.
At its core, a state machine consists of a finite number of states, transitions between these states, and inputs that trigger state transitions. Each state represents a specific condition or mode of operation that the system can be in, and the transitions define how the system moves from one state to another based on input events or conditions.
There are two main types of state machines: deterministic and nondeterministic. In deterministic state machines, the next state is uniquely determined by the current state and input. In contrast, nondeterministic state machines can have multiple possible next states for a given input, requiring additional mechanisms to resolve the ambiguity.
