# Dog-Feeder

An automatic dog feeder is a device designed to dispense food to your dog at pre-determined intervals or on-demand without requiring your direct involvement. It can be a convenient solution for pet owners who have busy schedules, need to be away from home for extended periods, or want to regulate their dog's feeding schedule more effectively. 

The purpose of this project is to understand how arduino UNO works to perform multiple tasks simultaneously or respond to external events while still maintaining a sense of time. Millis() fucntion is used for implementing non-blocking delays and timing in Arduino sketches. Unlike the delay() function, which pauses the entire program for a specified duration, millis() allows you to create time-dependent behavior without blocking the execution of other tasks.
